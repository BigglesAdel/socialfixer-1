WHAT IS SOCIAL FIXER?
=====================

Social Fixer makes FaceBook tolerable in Firefox.  Maybe other browsers, but I
don't know.  I use Firefox.

HOW DO I USE THIS CONFIGURATION?
================================

1) Install Social Fixer per the instructions on their site.
2) Open socialfixer.js in an editor, select all text, copy to clipboard.
3) Go to www.facebook.com and open the Social Fixer configuration.  It is
   called Edit Social Fixer Options.
4) Click the User Preferences tab.
5) Paste the entire contents from socialfixer.js in to the one field on
   this tab.  Overwrite anything already there.
6) Click Save.

You will lose any existing customizations you've done to Social Fixer, but there's no easy way to merge socialfixer.js with an existing configuration.  If I'm wrong and you know how, let me know.


HOW DO I UPDATE socialfixer.js?
